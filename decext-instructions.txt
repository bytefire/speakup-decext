Hi,

Here are the steps in detail. Before starting this, please download following two files that I have shared:
> speakup.tgz: https://github.com/bytefire/speakup-decext/raw/master/speakup.tgz
> tty-export.patch: https://github.com/bytefire/speakup-decext/raw/master/tty-export.patch

1. Download Linux kernel code:
	a. download stable kernel source from https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.10.9.tar.xz
	b. extract the archive by running: tar xvfJ linux-4.10.9.tar.xz

2. Apply patches:
	a. cd into the extracted linux source code: cd linux-4.10.9
	b. remove speakup directory: rm -r drivers/staging/speakup
	c. copy the speakup.tgz file into drivers/staging: cp path/to/speakup.tgz drivers/staging/
	d. cd into staging directory: cd drivers/staging
	e. extractspeakup.tgz: tar xvfz speakup.tgz
	(now there should be a speakup directory inside drivers/staging)
	f. cd back to the root of kernel source (i.e. linux-4.10.9) : cd ../..
	g. apply the tty patch: patch -p1 < path/to/tty-export.patch
	(output of above should be following three lines:
		patching file drivers/tty/tty_io.c
		patching file drivers/tty/tty_port.c
		patching file include/linux/tty.h)
	(if you don't already have 'patch' program then you can download it from http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/patch/)
	h. now we have the code ready for configuring and compiling!

3. Configure:
	a. make sure you are inside kernel source root directory, i.e. linux-4.10.9
	b. make sure that existing kernel config exists: ls /boot/config-$(uname -r)
	(this should return just one file named config-<your-kernel-version>)
	c. copy that file into your kernel source root directory: cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) ./.config
	d. update the config: make oldconfig
	(this will ask you many questions. just select the default option for each by pressing enter)
	e. check to make sure that speakup is configured the way you wanted it: cat .config | grep SPEAKUP
	e. that's it, kernel configured!

4. Compile and install:
	(IMPORTANT: for this please check an online guide specific for your distro.
	  following instructions that i think should work on Debian based system. but it may 
	a. still stayin inside linux-4.10.9, compile by simply running: make
	(this will take a while. depending on the hardware specs, it may take an hour or may be more)
	b. after make completes, check it succeeded: echo $?
	(this should return zero)
	c. now run: sudo make modules_install
	(again this may take a little while)
	d. now install kernel which should be quick: sudo make install
	(NOTE: this means that on next reboot your newly compiled kernel will load)
	(Depending on your distro, it should back up previous kernel)

5. Reboot and test decext:
	a. now running reboot should boot the compiled kernel
	b. if speakup configuration was same as before, then you should be able to test it with decext the same way as before.
